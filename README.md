## Handwritten Digit Classification with KNN Method

The goal of this course project is to optimally classify hand written digits by using k-nearest neighbor algorithm with different initializations and a simple data. This data is composed of either one stroke or two strokes and consists all digits from 0 to 9. In this algorithm, minimization of the number of data to represent each stroke is aimed. Normalization and centralization methods are implemented and the distance between strokes are calculated by Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. To train the data, k-fold method is used and resulting accuracy and f1 scores are compared for different setups.
